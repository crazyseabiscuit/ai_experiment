data simulation is possible? yeah but it is very hard


AI solution is integrated with cloud services and open source framwork/software, engineering is easy to use them now.we can just download a pretrained model, use just a small dataset to train a machine learning model, even more we can use a existing software or cloud service to fullfill the AI feature for the requirments, so we don't need to train a model by ourself at all,not only normal company, in the early 2022, black industry they use deepface to replace the images and videos human faces to scam and fraud in China. It seems AI technology is very promising and completed for all of us,why the title is "AI 2022 the darkness before dawn"? Why industry agree there are still many blockers from using these technololy to create bussiness values?
The short answer is there are many limitations, AI content genration is very popular recently, We will go through AI content generation like chatGPT firstly.


### AI content generation
chatgpt : optimizing language models fo dialogue , demonstrate how to fullly use the labled data for chat 
disadvantage: it still make simple mistake

personalize is not possible and content

stable diffusion: Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.
